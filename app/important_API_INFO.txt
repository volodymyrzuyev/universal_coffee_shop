A fetch() promise only rejects when the request fails, for example, 
because of a badly-formed request URL or a network error. A fetch() 
promise does not reject if the server responds with HTTP status codes 
that indicate errors (404, 504, etc.). Instead, a then() handler must 
check the Response.ok and/or Response.status properties.
